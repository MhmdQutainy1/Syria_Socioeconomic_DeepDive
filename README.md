# üß† Socioeconomic Indicators Analysis ‚Äì Syria

This project presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of **real-world socioeconomic indicators for Syria**, including GDP, unemployment, inflation, population, school enrollment, and life expectancy. The real dataset was obtained from the [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/) and manually cleaned, merged, and structured for in-depth analysis.

## üìä Project Summary

- üîç **Goal:** Analyze trends and relationships among key development indicators in Syria over several decades.
- üìÖ **Time Range:** Multi-year dataset spanning historical and recent economic events (including pre-/post-war periods).
- üìà **Indicators Analyzed:**
  - GDP (Gross Domestic Product)
  - Unemployment Rate
  - Inflation Rate
  - Life Expectancy
  - Population
  - School Enrollment

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## üì¶ Data Source

- üìÇ **Source:** [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/)
- üßπ **Preprocessing:** All data was downloaded as individual `.csv` files, cleaned (renamed columns, removed/filled missing values, normalized formats), and merged into a unified analysis-ready dataset.
- üìÅ **Data Format:** Cleaned dataset included in `/data/` folder.

## üî¨ Key Insights & Questions Explored

‚úÖ Answered visually and statistically inside the Jupyter Notebook:

- How has Syria‚Äôs GDP changed over time?
- Is there a correlation between GDP and unemployment?
- Do rising inflation rates correlate with drops in school enrollment?
- Are there years where life expectancy remained high despite economic decline?
- How does population growth relate to inflation and GDP?
- Which years showed the highest or lowest socioeconomic performance?
- Is life expectancy impacted more by economic or social factors?

## üìå What Makes This Project Stand Out?

‚úÖ **Real data** ‚Äî from the World Bank, not synthetic or academic samples.  
‚úÖ **Full-cycle analysis** ‚Äî from raw data to structured insights.  
‚úÖ **Clean, modular Jupyter notebook** ‚Äî readable, logical, and reusable.  
‚úÖ **Professional visualization** ‚Äî includes scatter plots, regressions, trend lines, heatmaps, boxplots.  
‚úÖ **Domain understanding** ‚Äî with real-world context (e.g., war impact, social infrastructure).  
‚úÖ **Ready for extension** ‚Äî can be used as a base for predictive modeling (Machine Learning).

## üß™ Next Step (Coming Soon...)

> Build a machine learning regression model to **predict Life Expectancy** based on GDP, Inflation, School Enrollment, and Unemployment.
